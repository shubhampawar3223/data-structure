Linked List-
-These elements are not stored in continious manner.
-elements are linked using pointers.

Advantages-
-dynamic size.
-Ease of Insertion and deletion.
-In array memory is assigned in compile time whereas in LL it is assigned at execution time.
-Accessing an element is fast in array ,wheras it is slow in Linked list.
-Memory utilization of LL is efficient as compared to array.


Disadvantages-
-arrays have better cache locality .
-More memory is required for pointer.
-Random access is not allowed.
